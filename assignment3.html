    <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
    <p>Activity 1 was a good way to learn how to search better using search engines and to learn more about the
        technicalities of search engines. I learned some new things I can do by searching on Google. One of the new things I
        learned and found interesting was the tools function that is available in the image results. I never saw this before
        I saw it in the tutorial. Another thing that is commonly available with search tabs, but I didn’t particularly come
        across this either is the advanced search with Google. I learned how to access this feature for Google. I can use
        what I learned in my environment by making use of the tools function to narrow down my search results when I’m
        searching for a certain image. I can use the advanced search to find specific results that aren’t being filtered in
        with the normal search.</p>

    <p>I experimented with Activity 2, and I found that bing has the simplest interface in terms of the search results and
        the amount of options and suggestions, but I think Google still has the best results and a simple interface for the
        home page. Google also has the highest market share, as I expected. This activity was useful for some general
        knowledge and to to interact with different search engines to see which search engine is preferred by the
        individual.</p>

    <p>Learning how Search Engine Optimization (SEO) works in Activity 4 is a useful skill for users as well as creators. I
        learned that results are optimized by having a full package of keywords, answers, a good interface, and more. SEO
        can be useful for my future environment if I have some sort of business site that I want having a high result. This
        is especially useful for users to get a website they often visit to become easily accessible if it already isn’t by
        sharing it and by leaving good feedback if possible.</p>
