Activity 1 went over some basics of what to do and what to watch out for in terms of security threats. I learned the importance of being aware of suspicious activity whenever I am browsing the internet. I also learned about the IPSec protocol that provides security at the IP layer. The common attack method that is used is phishing is good to be aware of and avoiding suspicious links in e-mails would keep me safe from most of these attempts. I can use what I learned in my environment to stay secure while I am using my devices. I can check the domain of websites and I can look for the lock icon on more important sites to make sure I am on a secure site.

Activity 2 is about good web browsing practices. I learned why staying clean and concise with internet usage is a good habit. Things like clearing the browser cache, staying up to date, removing any plug-ins that are unnecessary, and private browsing. Keeping add-ons to a bare minimum minimizes the risk that comes with them. Updating the browser and add-ons provides the latest version of patches. I don’t personally use the auto form, but I did have my address and my Harper account saved. I can use what I learned in my environment to keep everything related to my browser to the best safety. I will continue to update my browser and I will make sure to clear browsing data and auto form settings.

Activity 4 is important for password and account security. I learned the importance of securing my accounts with a strong password using a password manager. I also learned to use 2FA or MFA where it is available to add steps to my login processes. Both of these are vital because password managers not only mitigate password fatigue but provide you with very strong passwords for each of your accounts. MFA would require verification of who I am and if a specific account isn’t mine, I wouldn’t be able to log in even if I have the password. I can use what I learned in this Activity to continue using password managers to keep my passwords as strong as possible without having to remember them. I will also continue to use MFA on my important accounts to keep out anyone that isn’t supposed to access them.
