    <h1>Assignment 5</h1>
    <p>For Activity 1 in lesson 5, I decided to explore Flickr, since I am familiar with a lot of the other social media. I
        found it useful for having photos on your page that others you know can look at. I learned that social media is
        widely used for a variety of things like connecting with others, marketing, relaying information, and much more. I
        use this in my environment to communicate with others. I also use LinkedIn to connect with people who are involved
        in the IT field. Social media like LinkedIn and other social networking apps are also useful for my future
        environment to find a job. I can also use social media platforms for marketing when it comes to business.</p>

    <p>In Activity 2 of lesson 6, I tried out Skype and I learned all of its functions that are available to its users. I
        know that Skype was used often for communicating in a lot of workplaces because my father used it for that some time
        ago. I learned the proper way to use these messaging applications and how they work over the Internet. I can use
        what I learned for communication that is related to work. For example, I have a WhatsApp group chat that I am in for
        work. I can also use what I learned in my future for future jobs and to communicate with others.</p>

    <p>In Activity 5 of lesson 6, I learned more about piracy and the legalities of free use. This is good to know so you
        can stay within the parameters of what is legal to avoid penalties. I also got a site that has a list of several
        authorized and safe sites where permission is granted and content is available for downloading and/or streaming. I
        can use what I learned to stay within the legal parameters when I am downloading anything from the Internet. When I
        am downloading a sound file, I can use the website I found and saved that lists authorized sites to download them
        legally.</p>
