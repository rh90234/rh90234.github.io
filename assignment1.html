Activity 1 was a lot of review of some of the basics that I have learned throughout my journey, but there were some new things I learned about internet connectivity. I learned about the different connection types like Dial-up Connection, SDN, and DSL and the different ways that they work. From the protocols used to the different interfaces and digital subscriber lines that are used respectively. The things I learned in this activity can be of use to me in my future home and work environment if I ever have to set up an internet connection by thinking through which type of connection is best and why.

A lot of the concepts and functionality in Activity 2 were also previous knowledge because of my experiences. Some of the file functionality and keyboard shortcuts were new ones that I learned and tested out. From the keyboard shortcuts, I learned ways to navigate to the next or previous word strictly with the keyboard and even how to select these words. This can be useful whenever I am typing on a document to use these shortcuts to cut some time. For file shortcuts, I learned how to select files from a selection point to the endpoint and all the files that come in between. This is useful if you have files organized by a specific order that puts them into an order that would make this shortcut useful.

Activity 5 was particularly interesting to do because I got to experiment with my IP address and see how accurate the geolocation is. After checking my IP address on keycdn and receiving a latitude and longitude, I saw that the location was not that far from where I do live. This taught me that geolocation reveals a general area that near you. This can be helpful to know for yourself because it gives you a sense of some privacy of knowing that your IP doesnâ€™t necessarily reveal your address.
