    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
    <p>Activity 1 had a lot of information about the technicalities of web browsers and it had lots of tips for internet
        optimization and security. I learned about the infrastructure of web browsers. They use controllers,
        interpreters, and client programs as components that are implemented in web browsers. I also got an overview of
        some of the protocols that are used for the client program and how the controller/interpreter utilizes them.
        Most of the internet tips was review, but I got a better understanding of things like digital tracking and URLs.
        These concepts can be put into current use by putting into use internet usage optimization and security tips
        that I have not already done.</p>

        <p>After trying out all the browsers listed in this session, I went ahead and configured my chrome settings for
        Activity 4 to make my usage of the browser fit to my preferences. I learned about these different web browsers
        and how all of them have the same functions for user interaction, but their layout and advanced settings may
        differ from one to another. I can use this in my current and future environment by personalizing my browser
        settings and configuring them to suit my preferences.</p>

        <p>Browser plug-ins and extensions can be very useful for additional functionality in the internet browsing
        environment. Activity 5 taught me how I can disable or even remove any extensions that I don’t want anymore. It
        also taught me more about the options that are available for plug-ins like disabling it instead of removing it,
        but I think just removing it is better unless it’s only for a short period. I have the Grammarly, Dashlane, and
        Ad-blocker extensions for my Chrome browser. I can use what I learned in the activity in my current and future
        environment to use plug-ins and to stay safe by removing any plug-ins I no longer use. I will also need to stay
        away from installing</p>
