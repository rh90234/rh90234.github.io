    <h1>Assignment 9</h1>
    <p>In this lesson, I learned the basics of HTML. I learned the building blocks of web pages. In the lesson, I also
        learned how to host a website with GitHub Pages. It was a struggle at first, but I ended up figuring it out. I
        envision using what I have learned in this lesson to help me in my current environment with upcoming activities
        and assignments. I envision using this knowledge in my future environment to help me create a website that I may
        need or for others. Small businesses look for things like the ability for someone to create a website that suits
        their needs, so this is a valuable skill to have.</p>
