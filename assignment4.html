E-mail is something that we commonly use in out educational and work lives. Activity 1 outlined the basics of e-mail. I already know a lot of the basics and the functionality of e-mail. E-mail is often used by black hat hackers for phishing attacks. It is important to have awareness of such e-mails that may be forgery and that may have malicious intent. The best way this is done is by visiting the website of the sender and making sure that it was sent by the official e-mail address of who that e-mail claims to be. Gmail is the most popular platform that is used for e-mails and it has built-in functions to filter out suspicious e-mails and even let you know with warning text. These basics are useful to stay safe on the internet and protect your information and privacy.

Sending, receiving, and responding to e-mail is a vital skill in the professional world. I send and response to e-mails multiple times during a week. E-mails are the primary form of communication in the professional world, so everyone should know how to send them. This skill is important  in my current environment and will be useful in the future because of its relevance in the modern world. Instant messaging and e-mail are often used in out daily lives and in the professional world.

Activity 4 taught me a good defense method against spoofed e-mail messages that may be used for a malicious intent by hackers. I learned how to view e-mail headers and verify if they are sent by who they claim to be. This is important to know if you use e-mail regularly and you also want to protect your private information. This helps in preventing phishing attacks. This is useful for my current and future environment because of the risks that come with e-mails and knowing how you can mitigate this risk is important.
