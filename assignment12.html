    <h1>Assignment 12</h1>
    <p>In this lesson, I learned how the accessibility of a webpage is checked and extended to be accessible to the maximum
        number of people possible. This is important because many people may have a visual impairment or cannot physically
        move. Some may not be able to hear properly or even at all. I learned how to make sure colors on the page contrast
        and visible clearly using WebAIM. Speech recogonition would help those that can't physically move. Some of the
        assistive technology benefit everyone like captions for a video. I can incorporate what I learned into my
        environment to make my webpages accessible even to those that have a disability. It is unfair to them if they can't
        use the internet the same way that can and it can also be lost business depending on what the webpage is for.</p>
