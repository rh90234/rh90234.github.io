    <script>
        document.getElementById("Hello").innerHTML = "Hello Huzaifa!";

    <p>In this lesson, I learned about JavaScript and how it is used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to build webpages. I
        learned how certain tags can be edited by using specific phrases and by including an ID for the tag. I also learned
        how to add buttons to a webpage with JavaScript. Another thing I learned was using the canvas tag to draw things on
        the webpage with JavaScript and how they can be animated. I can use what I learned in this lesson to help me use
        Javascript with HTML and CSS to build webpages. I also will continue learning more about these topics to further my
        abilities in making webpages.</p>
