    <p style="color:blue;">In this lesson, I learned what CSS is and how it is used. CSS is for styling whatever is on
        the webpage and works side-by-side with HTML. I also learned the three ways CSS can be added to a webpage, being
        internal, external, and inline. I can use what I learned in this lesson in my current environement to for
        assignments and activities. I can also use this basic CSS knowledge to build upon website creating to help me in
        future environments. This can be handy in future environments to pair it with JavaScript, which would be the
        third essential to websites and to help me develop webpages for myself or for others that may require that
        service.</p>
