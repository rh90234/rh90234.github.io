    <p>In this lesson about databases, I learned how data is stored in an organized way by using relational databases with
    SQL. I also learned how to use write SELECT statements for single-table and multi-table queries. The final thing I
    learned from the activities in this lesson is using the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries to make changes to
    tables. I envision using what I learned in my current education to learn more about databases and SQL. I envision
    needing to use this skill in the work environment especially in my first years for entry-level jobs in the IT field.
    I envision taking what I know about databases to work on the security aspect, since data breaches are common.</p>
