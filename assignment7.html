In Activity 1, I learned more about the OSI and TCP/IP reference models. I also learned about the differences between the common internet protocols. I learned the functionality of each layer of the OSI model and I got a better understanding of the TCP/IP model. I didn’t previously know much about the TCP/IP model, but I had familiarity with the OSI model. The different internet protocols gave me a good understanding on what a specific protocol does. I can use what I learned in this activity for my educational environment to help me get my Network+ certification. This will help me in my future environment by contributing to my resume to find a satisfactory job.

In Activity 3, I learned how to properly check and verify my internet connection. I learned how to check ip configurations for my system using the CLI. I also learned how to ping an address and also how to trace the route of a host on the internet. I also learned about the nslookup command which is useful to find more information about a domain or host. What I learned can be used in my current environment to assist me with any common issues I face with internet connectivity. These can also be helpful in the future when I install a new internet connection to check and make sure everything works.

Activity 4 was about sharing folders and then connecting to these shared folders. I learned how to use the CLI and the GUI to share folders and how to connect to shared folders. This activity reminded me about how Airdrop is. Although I haven’t used the Airdrop feature in some time, I can see how sharing folders is similar to airdropping media to someone in your proximity. I think that this isn’t the most useful because everyone can store whatever they want and usually you can send a link to whatever they want to share like how it is for Google Drive. I can use what I learned to utilize this feature at times when I cannot share a link to a folder.
