In Activity 1, I learned a structured way of keeping goals using the SMART acronym. I also learned some research tips on salaries for a career I might be interested in. Making these goals that follow the SMART structure is good because it provides quantifiable and measurable standards to set. The career planning document was helpful because I got to get all my thoughts and goals written down to keep with me and reflect upon as I continue working through my studies and eventually land a career in cyber security. I can use the SMART goals for any planning and goal-setting I do in the future. 

In Activity 2, I learned more about the importance of planning ahead for a career. Finding a career path that you like can be difficult, but this session is helpful in exploring options. Doing research on career requirements and salary ranges is important to do ahead of time so I will be able to get a satisfactory job in the cyber security field. I also learned that value that certifications add to your resume and your potential. I will use what I learned in my current environment to get certifications that are revenant to my career path. I will also make sure to find the general requirements for a job I am interested like penetration testing. 

In Activity 3, I learned how to to write a resume, since I havenâ€™t really focused on that prior to this session. This is important because job prospects in the profession world use resumes or applicants to judge whether they want to potentially bring you in or not. I also learned the importance of networking with those that can help find you a job. My father works in Database and he is someone who can help me find a job in the IT field. I can use what I learned in my current and future environment to improve my resume and networking with others using social networking platforms like LinkedIn to find a job that is to my liking.
