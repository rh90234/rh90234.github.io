    <p>In this lesson, I learned concepts of project management. Some of these concepts include but are not limited to
        initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing. I also learned that projects are different from
        operations because they are unique and have an end date. One thing I learned to create was a Gantt chart. I am using
        this Gantt chart for my project scheduling. Learning how to make a Gantt chart is helpful to me because it's a
        different way to visualize a schedule. I plan on continuing to use Gantt charts and project management concepts I
        learned to help me with future projects in education as well as outside of education.</p>
