    <p>In this lesson, I learned the differences between raster and vector images. I also learned how to add images, audio,
        and video formats that are supported by HTML into my webpage. One of the things I found that is particularly useful
        was the tutorial on adding YouTube videos onto a webpage. This is because it makes it convenient for users to have a
        video available to view that may assist them. I can use what I learned to add media to webpages to make it visually
        appealing. I will also use the YouTube video HTML feature for things like videos of products and video tutorials
        related to the site.</p>
